        <h2><b><u>&nbsp;1.The Great Wall Of China:</u></b></h2>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Great Wall of China is one of the most famous and impressive structures in the world. It was built to protect ancient China from invasions and raids by enemies, especially from the north. Stretching over 13,000 miles, the wall winds through mountains, deserts, and plains, making it the longest wall ever built by humans.Construction of the Great Wall began as early as the 7th century BC, but most of the wall seen today was built during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644). The wall was made using stone, brick, earth, and wood. Watchtowers, barracks, and fortresses were also built along the wall to house soldiers and keep a lookout for approaching threats.The Great Wall is not just a military defense system; it is also a symbol of China's strength, unity, and determination. It shows the incredible engineering skills of ancient Chinese workers, many of whom worked in harsh conditions to build this enormous structure.</p>
